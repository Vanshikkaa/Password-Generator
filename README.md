# Password-Generator
The Random Password Generator is a tool designed to create secure, random passwords that enhance online security and prevent unauthorized access. Built with a focus on strong password policies and customization, this project aims to provide users with a highly configurable password generation experience.

Key Features:

1. Customizable Password Length: Users can select the desired length for their password, ranging from short to highly complex, ensuring adaptability for various security requirements.
2. Character Set Options: Choose specific character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, to customize password strength and meet security guidelines.
3. Advanced Security Settings: Enable or disable options like consecutive character prevention, avoiding similar characters (e.g., I, l, 1), and enforcing unique characters to prevent easily guessable patterns.
4. One-Click Copy: Quickly copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy pasting into password fields without manual typing errors.
5. Responsive User Interface: Built with a clean, intuitive design, ensuring easy navigation and use across devices.



Use Cases:
Personal Security: Generate strong passwords for personal accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Business Compliance: Comply with organizational security policies by creating complex passwords that meet specific criteria.
Developer Tool: Useful for developers who need to quickly generate secure passwords for testing or demo environments.


Technologies Used:
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for an interactive and responsive user experience.
Optional Back-End (for additional security features): Node.js or Python Flask if server-side generation or storage is required for enhanced security.


This project is ideal for anyone seeking to improve their security posture by ensuring strong, unpredictable passwords are used for sensitive accounts and applications.
